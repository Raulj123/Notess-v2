# Notess üìù

Notess is a full CRUD application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and update notes. The project is built using Svelte, Pico CSS, and Elephantsql.

## Features  ‚ú®

- ‚úèÔ∏è  Create a new note 
- ‚úèÔ∏è  Edit an existing note
- ‚ùå  Delete a note

## Inspiration üí°
This project draws inspiration from my previous Notes project and the article ["Making a Simple Note App using Svelte and Vite"](https://medium.com/the-web-tub/making-a-simple-note-app-using-svelte-and-vite-27edfa91a591). While incorporating ideas from these sources, I have also added my own customizations to enhance the frontend.

## Contributing ü§ù
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Before and After 
The main difference in the "After" version is the addition of more styles to the note card. This enhances the visual appeal and user experience.
Also using a diffrent framework and languages. 
Here's an example showcasing the difference:
<div align="center">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <h3><a href="https://github.com/Raulj123/Notess/tree/main">Notess v1</a></h3>
      <img width="350" height="350" src="https://github.com/Raulj123/Notess/blob/main/media/demo_run.gif?raw=true" alt="demo gif">
    </td>
    <td>
      <h3>Notess v2</h3>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
